## Overview

Morgan is a PyPI mirror for restricted/offline networks/environments, where
access to the Internet is not available. It allows creating small mirrors that
can be used by multiple "client" Python environments (i.e. CPython versions,
operating systems, etc.). The Morgan server is a single-file script that only
uses modules the standard Python library, making it easy to deploy in such
environments.

The basic idea is to run the mirror utility where Internet access is available—which
generates a directory tree ("package index") with all of the required packages,
their dependencies, and the server script—then copy this tree to the restricted
network (going through whatever security policies are in place), run the server
inside the restricted network, and set `pip` in the client environments to use
the mirror instead of pypi.org, which they can't access anyway.

## Features and Concepts

- Runs under **Python 3.7 and up** (both server and mirrorer).
- Package index is a **simple directory tree** that can be easily archived, copied,
  rsynced, etc.
- Package index contains a **configuration file** that lists **markers** for
  different client **environments** and a list of **package requirement strings** as per [PEP 508](https://peps.python.org/pep-0508/).
- Mirrorer automatically and **recursively mirrors dependencies** of all direct
  requirements.
- Only mirrors **optional dependencies** if they were part of the requirement
  strings (a.k.a "extras"), or are relevant to the environment markers. This is
  true for direct requirements and for dependencies of dependencies.
- For each requirement, downloads the **latest version** that satisfies the
  requirement (e.g. "requests>=2.24.0,<2.27.0" will download 2.26.0, whereas
  "requests" will download the latest available version).
- Downloads both **source distributions** and **binary distributions**. Only binary
  distributions that are relevant to either of the environment markers defined in
  the configuration file are downloaded.
- **Server** is a one-file script with **no dependencies** outside the standard library
  available in Python 3.7 and above. The script is automatically extracted into
  the package index.
- Server implements [PEP 503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/) (Simple Repository API),
  [PEP 658](https://peps.python.org/pep-0658/) (Serve Distribution Metadata in the Simple Repository API),
  and [PEP 691](https://peps.python.org/pep-0691/) (JSON-based Simple API for Python Package Indexes).

## Installation

Morgan is meant to be used as a command line utility (although it can be used
as a library if necessary), therefore it is recommended to install via a utility
such as [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx):

```sh
pipx install morgan
```

You can also install it directly through `pip`:

```sh
python3 -m pip install morgan
```

## Usage

1. Create a directory where the package index will reside.
2. Create a "morgan.ini" file in this directory, with at least one environment
   definition and list of requirements (see [Sample Configuration File](#sample-configuration-file) below).
   You can use `morgan generate_env >> morgan.ini` to generate a configuration
   block for the local interpreter. You can also use `morgan generate_reqs >> morgan.ini`
   to generate list of requirements from all packages installed in the current
   environment, which is especially useful when using virtual environments.
3. Run the mirrorer from inside the package index via `morgan mirror` (alternatively,
   provide the path of the package index via the `--index-path` flag).
4. Copy the package index to the target environment, if necessary.
5. Run the server using `python3 server.py`. Use `--help` for a full list of
   flags and options. You can also use `morgan server` instead.

### Sample Configuration File

Environment configuration blocks can be automatically generated via
`morgan generate_env`. I recommend you read the "Environment Markers" section of
[PEP 508](https://peps.python.org/pep-0508/#environment-markers) to see exactly how they are calculated.

```ini
[env.legacy]
python_version = 3.9
python_full_version = 3.9.9
os_name = posix
platform_tag = linux-x86_64
sys_platform = linux
platform_machine = i686
platform_python_implementation = CPython
platform_system = Linux
implementation_name = cpython

[env.edge]
os_name = posix
platform_tag = linux-x86_64
sys_platform = linux
platform_machine = x86_64
platform_python_implementation = CPython
platform_system = Linux
python_version = 3.12
python_full_version = 3.12.7
implementation_name = cpython

[env.windows]
os_name = nt
platform_tag = win_amd64
sys_platform = win32
platform_machine = AMD64
platform_python_implementation = CPython
platform_system = Windows
python_version = 3.12
python_full_version = 3.12.7
implementation_name = cpython

[requirements]
requests = >=2.24.0
protobuf = ==3.20.1
redis = >4.1.0,<4.2.1
xonsh = [full]~=0.11.0
```

In this example we can see two different client environments: a "legacy" one with
a relatively old installation of CPython 3.7.7 on 32-bit Linux, and an "edge"
environment with a recent installation of CPython 3.10.6 on 64-bit Linux.

All these different markers are needed because they can be used in package
metadata, and Morgan needs them to determine which files and dependencies to
download.

This configuration file sets "requests", "protobuf", "redis" and "xonsh" as the
packages to mirror, with certain version specifications for each. The xonsh
requirements also specifies an extra which results in the downloading of certain
optional dependencies. When the mirrorer is executed on a directory that contains this configuration file, it will find the
latest version that satisfies the specifications of each package, download
relevant files for each of them, and then recursively download _their_
dependencies. It will download source files suitable for any environment, and
binary distributions (wheels) that match the definitions of the "legacy" and
"edge" environments.

Configuration markers for a specific environment can easily be generated by
running the provided `generate_env` command in the target environment.

### Setting Up Multiple Mirrors

You can set up multiple PyPI mirrors by using separate configuration files.
To do so, simply add the `-c` or `--config` flag with the path of the
configuration file to all relevant morgan commands. For example:

```sh
morgan mirror --index-path /opt/pypi-mirror-1 --config /usr/local/etc/pypi-mirror-1.ini
morgan serve --index-path /opt/pypi-mirror-2 --config /usr/local/etc/pypi-mirror-2.ini
```

### Mirroring From Other Indexes

To mirror from a package index different than PyPI, simply provide the
`-I` or `--index-url` flag with the URL of the index.

## How Does Morgan Resolve Dependencies?

Dependency resolution in Python is hard. The standard for specifying dependencies
was only created in 2015 with [PEP 508](https://peps.python.org/pep-0508/). For years (and to this day), many projects
have used setuptools for distribution, which had its own mechanisms for
dependency specifications. Many Python packages define their dependencies in
non-standard files such as Setuptools' requires.txt file, and not in their actual
METADATA files, despite the latter supporting dependency specification. Today,
setuptools has moved to using the newer pyproject.toml format standardized by
[PEP 621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/).

Many tools that attempt to extract requirements from package metadata, such as
[pkginfo](https://pythonhosted.org/pkginfo/), do not return dependencies listed outside standard METADATA files.
[pip-tools](https://pip-tools.readthedocs.io/) is the only tool outside of pip
itself that can resolve dependencies from multiple sources, but like pip itself,
it is not meant to be used as a library, and it is also meant to be used on
project development sources, not project distributions.

Morgan, therefore, implements its own dependency resolution (which heavily relies
on the [packaging](https://pypi.org/project/packaging/) library). It utilizes an
incremental strategy for extracting metadata from package distributions (whether
source or binary distributions), parsing any file that may contain necessary
metadata. Currently this includes METADATA, PKG-INFO, requires.txt,
setup_requires.txt and pyproject.toml files. Morgan also takes into account
build dependencies to ensure that packages that are necessary to compile source
distributions are also available in the mirror (so, if a source distribution
requires [hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/) in order to build, Morgan will ensure hatch is mirrored as
well).

It should be noted that recursively resolving dependencies is difficult, and
requires care in order to prevent circular dependencies. Morgan's current
strategy is very simple and possibly too broad, and although I haven't yet found
any issues, they may happen. Please open a ticket if you encounter any such
issues.

## Limitations

- Morgan currently only targets CPython. Packages/binary files that are specific
  to other Python implementations are not mirrored. This may change in the
  future.

- Morgan only targets Python 3 packages. Python 2 packages are not mirrored and
  there's no currently any plan to support them.

- The only binary distributions supported are wheels. Eggs are not supported and
  probably never will be.

- The Morgan server is currently read-only. Packages cannot be published to the
  index through it. This may change in the future.

- Morgan does not mirror packages with versions that do not comply with
  [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#version-scheme).
  These are generally older packages that are no longer accepted by PyPI anyway.
  This is unlikely to change.

- Morgan does not mirror yanked files (see [PEP 592](https://peps.python.org/pep-0592/)). This is how PyPI supports
  removing files without breaking projects that are specifically pinned to
  them. This was a conscious decision that will probably not change, but
  may be made configurable.

## Why Not Use X?

Morgan was written because of insufficiencies of other mirroring solutions:

- [bandersnatch](https://github.com/pypa/bandersnatch/) is geared more towards mirroring of the entire PyPI repository,
  with support for different filters to reduce/limit the size of the mirror.
  Unfortunately, it doesn't automatically download dependencies of direct
  requirements, making the "package" filter virtually unusable, and the "platform"
  filters are not fine-grained enough. It also has many dependencies outside the
  standard library.
- [localshop](https://github.com/jazzband/localshop) is a proxy that basically caches PyPI responses to `pip` requests,
  so it's not useful for restricted networks. It also has many non-standard-library
  dependencies, and can't download binary distributions for multiple environments.
- [devpi](https://www.devpi.net/) also works as a caching proxy, and also attempts to automatically refresh
  from PyPI at regular intervals. It also has many non-standard-library
  dependencies.
- [pypickup](https://github.com/UB-Quantic/pypickup) was started around the same time as Morgan. It is more fitting for
  and offline mirror than the above three but takes a different approach than Morgan. It
  doesn't include a server, instead relying on `pip`'s ability to install from
  a directory tree, so this tree needs to be accessible to your servers. It also
  favors CLI commands over a configuration file (e.g. an `add` command is used to
  mirror a dependency). I'm not sure how it resolves dependencies, if at all.

## Troubleshooting

- **pip fails installing a package file that exists.**

  If `pip` fails with a message similar to "ERROR: Could not find a version
  that satisfies the requirement FastAPI (from versions: 0.88.0)", despite
  package files existing with the correct version and platform, it may be
  that you're providing `pip` with a non-normalized name. You can either
  use the normalized name when installing (lowercase the package name and
  replace underscores with dashes, e.g. `pip install fastapi` instead of
  `pip install FastAPI`), or start the server with the `--no-metadata` flag,
  which will disable serving metadata files and workaround the issue. This seems
  to be a non-standard behavior in `pip`, as it is sending the normalized name
  to the server, but for some reason expecting to get the non-normalized name
  back.
